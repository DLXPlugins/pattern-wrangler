Manage your block patterns efficiently with Pattern Wrangler.

== Description ==

Pattern Wrangler makes managing WordPress block patterns simple and efficient, with features that cater to both beginners and advanced users. Whether you're organizing patterns for a complex site, a hybrid setup, or just hiding ones you don't need, Pattern Wrangler has you covered.

Here are the major features:

* **Hide All Patterns** - Completely hide patterns from the block editor in one click. This also hides the Patterns menu item.
* **Selective Hiding** - Hide core, remote, theme, or plugin patterns while keeping your custom patterns visible. You can also hide synced and unsynced patterns together or separately.
* **Category Management** - Disable, map, and rename registered categories from themes and plugins for better organization. This will help you keep local and registered patterns organized together.
* **Output Patterns Anywhere** - Use a shortcode to display local patterns in page builders, widgets, your theme,or other blocks.
* **Pattern Preview** - Preview a pattern on the frontend with shortcuts in the block editor or from the Patterns post list view.
* **Cross-Site Pattern Copying** - Transfer patterns, including the remote images, between WordPress sites effortlessly. This is useful if you're copying a pattern from one site to another or copying a pattern from a production site to a development site.

> Pattern Wrangler integrates seamlessly with block-based and classic themes offering a hybrid setup with unmatched flexibility.

=== Requirements and Compatibility ===

Requires WordPress 6.5 or higher. 6.7 is recommended.

Fully compatible with most themes, including block themes. Ideal for hybrid setups.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/pattern-wrangler` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the plugin through the block editor by adding new patterns or importing existing ones.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I import Patterns from any WordPress site? =

Yes! If you have the pattern's code, <a href="https://docs.dlxplugins.com/pattern-wrangler/features/the-pattern-importer-block">Pattern Wrangler can import it</a> and localize any associated images.

= Can I use Patterns in page builders like Elementor? =

Yes! You can use the `[wp_block slug="pattern-slug"]` shortcode <a href="https://docs.dlxplugins.com/pattern-wrangler/features/the-pattern-importer-block">to output block patterns anywhere</a> in your theme or other blocks.

= Does this work with Block Themes? =

Yes. Although it is designed for hybrid setups, it works with block themes, allowing you to merge theme and plugin-based patterns with your own local patterns stored in your database.

Pattern Wrangler simply makes visible the default `wp_block` post type and category, which is where local patterns are stored.

The Patterns view of this plugin uses the classic Patterns screen, with plans to eventually modernize it and put it on par with the Patterns viewer in the Full-Site Editor.

== Screenshots ==

1. An example of an organized Patterns screen.
2. Enhanced Patterns List View with shortcode and category/sync columns.
3. Map registered categories to terms, or rename for better organization or translations.
4. Enable the Customizer UI, and load Additional CSS in the block editor.
5. Hide all patterns, or hide them from core, remote, themes, or plugins.
6. Preview a Pattern on the frontend.
